# You are helping build a wellness app called Louie using SwiftUI. This file is part of an Xcode project that uses a freemium model and AI-generated insights based on user-tracked habits, mood, and health data.

Before writing code:
- Read the `Context.md` to understand project goals and constraints
- Ensure any data tracked is stored in CloudKit and formatted to be used by the AI insight engine
- Match the design language and structure seen in `ContentView.swift`
- Use modern Swift best practices and modularity
- Update `CHANGELOG.md` with any new changes

All edits should:
- Be fully functional in Xcode with SwiftUI previews working
- Avoid introducing Objective-C bridging
- Use @ObservedObject, @State, etc. appropriately
- Follow Louie’s UI style: dark gradients, friendly emoji-based components, playful language

Output only Swift code — no markdown blocks or explanation. All files must remain within `~/Documents/louie`.

Tag any file-level connections, e.g., "this view depends on Habit.swift in /Models".

Always ask for clarification if you’re unsure which data source or component is needed.
