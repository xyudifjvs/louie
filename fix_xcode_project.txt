# How to Fix the Xcode Project Issues

The current error is happening because Xcode has incorrect file references in its project file. Here's how to fix it:

## Fix Steps in Xcode:

1. Open Xcode and select your Louie.xcodeproj

2. In the Project Navigator (left sidebar), look for any folders with the path "Louie/Views" (not just "Views")

3. If you find any duplicated folder references:
   - Right-click on them
   - Select "Delete"
   - Choose "Remove Reference" (not "Move to Trash")

4. Also check for duplicate references to:
   - HabitStatsView.swift
   - HabitProgressCard.swift

5. Once all duplicate references are removed:
   - Product > Clean Build Folder
   - Quit and restart Xcode

6. If you're still having issues, try:
   - In Finder, delete the derived data folder: ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/Louie-*
   - Restart Xcode and rebuild

## Quick Solution for Now:

For now, we've simplified the HabitProgressCard to not use NavigationLink until we can properly fix the project references. This is why tapping the card will just print a message instead of navigating to the stats view.

After you fix the Xcode project references, you can update the HabitProgressCard.swift back to use NavigationLink with:

```swift
NavigationLink(destination: HabitStatsView(habit: habit, viewModel: habitTrackerViewModel)
    .transition(.move(edge: .bottom))
    .animation(.easeInOut, value: true)) {
    // Card content
}
.buttonStyle(PlainButtonStyle())
```
