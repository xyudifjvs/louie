# Troubleshooting Navigation Issues in Louie App

## Current Setup
The navigation structure in the app is:
- MainTabView (with NavigationStack/View for each tab)
  - HabitTrackerView
    - HabitDashboardView
      - NavigationLink to HabitCalendarView
        - HabitProgressCard (with NavigationLink to HabitStatsView)

## If Navigation Still Doesn't Work

1. **Rebuild the project**
   - Clean build folder (Product > Clean Build Folder)
   - Restart Xcode
   - Build and run

2. **Check View Hierarchy**
   - Ensure that NavigationLinks are within a NavigationStack/View
   - Verify that HabitCalendarView is properly navigated to
   - Check that the HabitStatsView is properly initialized

3. **Try Manual Navigation**
   - If the NavigationLink still doesn't work, you can try using this programmatic approach:
   ```swift
   @State private var showingStats = false
   @State private var selectedHabit: Habit? = nil
   
   // In HabitProgressCard:
   .onTapGesture {
       selectedHabit = habit
       showingStats = true
   }
   
   // Then in HabitCalendarView, add:
   .sheet(isPresented: $showingStats) {
       if let habit = selectedHabit {
           HabitStatsView(habit: habit, viewModel: habitTrackerViewModel)
       }
   }
   ```

4. **Check for Access Level Issues**
   - Make sure HabitStatsView and its initializer have appropriate access levels
   - If using `public` access, ensure parameter types also have `public` access

5. **Check for Layout Issues**
   - Try adding a border or background color to the NavigationLink to ensure it's rendering correctly
   - Ensure the view is not being clipped or hidden

6. **Debug Logging**
   - Add print statements in the tapped handler and NavigationLink destination to trace execution

Remember that navigation in SwiftUI can sometimes be tricky with nested views. If all else fails, consider using a simpler navigation approach like sheets or full-screen covers temporarily.
