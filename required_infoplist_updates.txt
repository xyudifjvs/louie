## Required Info.plist Updates for Nutrition Feature

When building the project in Xcode, please ensure the following camera permission descriptions are added to your Info.plist file:

```xml
<!-- Camera usage description -->
<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
<string>Louie needs camera access to analyze your meals and provide nutritional insights</string>

<!-- Photo Library usage description for saving photos -->
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>Louie needs photo library access to save meal photos</string>

<!-- Photo Library Add-only usage description for saving photos (iOS 11+) -->
<key>NSPhotoLibraryAddUsageDescription</key>
<string>Louie needs permission to save meal photos to your photo library</string>
```
